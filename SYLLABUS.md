## Course schedule each week

This course will be taught in a *flipped classroom* style of learning.  Lectures will be brief at the beginning of class, and will be meant primarily to orient the student to resources available in texts, online, and in each laboratory assignment.  Each week we will spend most of the remaining time in class working on laboratory assignments in a *think, pair, share* environment, where problems and questions will be discussed interactively during the class period.  On Thursday, 15 minutes prior to the end of class we will have a short Compass online quiz to *assess* student learning on the topic investigated in the laboratory each week.  Lab assignments will be assigned each Tuesday and due at 8 am the Tuesday following the class the lab is assigned.

## Grading, quizzes, and exams

The course will be graded as a weighted average: 60% will be the average of assignments, 30% for quizzes, and 10% for the final exam.  The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

Quizzes will be 10-question multiple choice, closed book, and administered online.  If you miss a quiz due to an unexcused absence, you will earn a 0.

The final exam will be 8:00-11:00 a.m., Thursday, December 17.  A makeup exam time may be scheduled if there is a conflict with another exam.

You are encouraged to work together on assignments, but work must be performed and submitted independently.  Plagarism or cheating on quizzes and the final exam will be handled according to the [Student Code](http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-402.html).

## Attendance policy

You are highly encouraged to attend classes, however, I will not take attendance.  On Thursdays you need to be in class to take the quizzes, which will begin promptly at 9:05 am.  Makeup quizzes and final exam will only be granted in cases of medical, personal emergencies, or academic activity conflicts (i.e. job interviews, university sports, etc.).  If you know you will miss class, let me and the TA know as soon as possible.

## Computer lab policy

Food and open top drinks are not allowed in our computer classrooms. In addition to the potential damage caused to our equipment, this can create an unsanitary environment and attract insects. Bringing food and drinks without lids may result in a minimum fee of $50 to your department to cover labor and equipment costs.  I will send Bob Rauber after the offender to recoup the costs to the department.  :)
